<h2>Desktop Computer Disassembly Guide</h2>
A comprehensive step-by-step tutorial for safely taking apart a desktop computer for educational, repair, or upgrade purposes.

<h2>üìã Overview</h2>
This guide provides detailed instructions for disassembling a desktop computer, complete with safety protocols, required tools, and visual documentation. This was a project I completed during my studies at Cape Cod Community College.

<h2>‚ö†Ô∏èSafety First</h2>
CRITICAL SAFETY WARNINGS:

Never touch the inside of a computer when it's turned on (except when using a multimeter)
NEVER remove the cover of a power supply or monitor - they contain lethal voltages even when unplugged
Always remove jewelry before starting
Use proper ESD protection to prevent component damage.
