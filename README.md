CRITICAL SAFETY WARNINGS:

Never touch the inside of a computer when it's turned on (except when using a multimeter)
NEVER remove the cover of a power supply or monitor - they contain lethal voltages even when unplugged
Always remove jewelry before starting
Use proper ESD protection to prevent component damage
